## What is Write-Through?

**Write-Through** is a caching pattern where writes go to both the cache and the database synchronously. The cache acts as the main interface for both reads and writes.

---

## How It Works

```
Application                Cache                Database
     │                       │                     │
     │─── Write(key, data) ─►│                     │
     │                       │                     │
     │                       │─── Write ──────────►│
     │                       │                     │
     │                       │◄── OK ─────────────│
     │                       │                     │
     │◄── OK ────────────────│                     │
```

Both cache and database are updated before returning success.

## Read Flow

```
Application                Cache                Database
     │                       │                     │
     │─── Read(key) ────────►│                     │
     │                       │                     │
     │◄── Data (if cached) ──│                     │
     │                       │                     │
     │        OR if miss:    │                     │
     │                       │─── Query ──────────►│
     │                       │◄── Data ───────────│
     │◄── Data ──────────────│                     │
```

## Advantages

| **Benefit** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| Cache always consistent | Writes update cache immediately |
| No stale data | Cache reflects DB state |
| Simple reads | Always read from cache |
| Data durability | DB always has latest |

---

## Disadvantages

| **Drawback** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Higher write latency | Must write to both |
| Cache may have unused data | Writes cached even if never read |
| Write amplification | Every write hits DB and cache |

---

## Use Cases

Good for:
- Data that's frequently read after write
- Strong consistency requirements
- Applications where write latency is acceptable

Not ideal for:
- Write-heavy workloads
- Data rarely read after write
- Latency-sensitive writes

---

## Comparison

| **Aspect** | **Write-Through** | **Cache-Aside** |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Write latency | Higher | Lower |
| Cache consistency | Always consistent | May be stale briefly |
| Cache population | On every write | On read (lazy) |
| Complexity | Cache handles writes | App manages both |

---

## Interview Tips

- Explain synchronous write to both cache and DB
- Discuss latency trade-off vs consistency benefit
- Compare with write-behind (async) pattern
- Mention when write-through is appropriate
