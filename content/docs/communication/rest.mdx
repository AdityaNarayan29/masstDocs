## What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources.

---

## REST Principles

| **Principle** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Stateless | Each request contains all info needed |
| Client-Server | Separation of concerns |
| Cacheable | Responses can be cached |
| Uniform Interface | Consistent resource-based URLs |
| Layered System | Client doesn't know if talking to server or intermediary |

---

## Resource-Based URLs

```
Good (resource-based):
GET    /users           # List users
GET    /users/123       # Get user 123
POST   /users           # Create user
PUT    /users/123       # Update user 123
DELETE /users/123       # Delete user 123

Bad (action-based):
GET /getUser?id=123
POST /createUser
POST /deleteUser
```

## HTTP Methods in REST

| **Operation** | **Method** | **Example** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Create | POST | `POST /users` |
| Read | GET | `GET /users/123` |
| Update (full) | PUT | `PUT /users/123` |
| Update (partial) | PATCH | `PATCH /users/123` |
| Delete | DELETE | `DELETE /users/123` |

---

## Request/Response Example

### Request
```http
POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/users/123

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

---

## Best Practices

| **Practice** | **Example** |
|-------------|------------|
| Use nouns, not verbs | `/users` not `/getUsers` |
| Use plural nouns | `/users` not `/user` |
| Nest for relationships | `/users/123/orders` |
| Use query params for filtering | `/users?role=admin` |
| Version your API | `/v1/users` or header |

---

## Pagination

```http
GET /users?page=2&limit=20

Response:
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100,
    "next": "/users?page=3&limit=20"
  }
}
```

## Interview Tips

- Explain REST principles (stateless, uniform interface)
- Design resource-based URLs properly
- Know when to use each HTTP method
- Discuss pagination, filtering, versioning
- Compare with GraphQL and gRPC
