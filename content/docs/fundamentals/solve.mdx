## Step-by-step guide to solving problems

In a High-Level Design interview, your goal is to present a scalable, secure, and well-reasoned design for a given problem.  
Here's a step-by-step guide to help you structure your answer.

> **Tip:** Use summary table to know what is mandatory

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Clarify the Problem Statement

Start by making sure you understand the requirements.

- Confirm the scope.
- Ask about the type of users.
- Determine if it's read-heavy, write-heavy, real-time, etc.

> **Example:** Are we building a real-time chat system for 1M DAUs, or async messaging like email?

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Define Functional Requirements

List out **what** the system should do.

- User-facing features (CRUD, login, analytics, etc.)
- Prioritize core features vs optional ones

> **For a URL shortener:**  
> - Generate short links  
> - Redirect to original URLs  
> - Track click stats  
> - Link expiry (optional)

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Define Non-Functional Requirements

Focus on the **quality** attributes:

- Scalability (e.g. 10M users)
- Availability (e.g. 99.99% uptime)
- Latency (e.g. < 200ms)
- Security (e.g. OAuth2, rate limiting)
- Durability and consistency

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Estimate Scale

Estimate user load, traffic, and storage.
[Learn to approach estimation in detail](/sd/fundamentals/estimate).

### üë• Users

- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)

### üîÑ Requests per second (RPS)

> 1M DAU √ó 5 requests/day ‚âà ~60 RPS

### üì¶ Storage

- Estimate size/item √ó number of items

### üßÆ Bandwidth

- Read/write ratio, data egress

---

## 5. API Design (Optional)

Design key APIs:

```http
POST /shorten
{
  "longUrl": "https://example.com"
}
‚Üí 201 Created
{
  "shortUrl": "mas.st/xy12"
}

GET /xy12
‚Üí 302 Redirect to long URL
```

Include rate limits, headers, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. High-Level Architecture

Draw major components:

- Clients (web/mobile)
- Load balancer
- App servers / Microservices
- Database(s)
- Caching layer
- Message queues

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Component Deep Dive

Choose and zoom into one or two core components:

- Short URL generation logic
- Feed generation in social media
- Notification system, etc.

---

## 8. Data Modeling

Mention core entities:

- Define DB tables or NoSQL collections
- Add indexes and relationships

---

## 9. Scaling Strategy

Show how your system can grow:

- Read scaling: Caching (Redis/CDN)
- Write scaling: Sharding, queues
- Horizontal scaling: more instances
- DB scaling: Read replicas, partitioning

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Trade-offs & Bottlenecks

Show engineering judgment:

- SQL vs NoSQL
- Consistency vs Availability (CAP theorem)
- In-memory speed vs persistence
- Async queues vs real-time API

---

## 11. Security & Monitoring

Briefly cover:

- Auth (JWT, OAuth2)
- Rate limiting
- Logs and metrics
- Alerting

---

## 12. Wrap Up

Summarize your system:

> We‚Äôve built a horizontally scalable, low-latency system with Redis caching, PostgreSQL DB, async queues, and 99.99% uptime.
