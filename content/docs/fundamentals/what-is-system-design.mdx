## What is System Design?

**System Design** is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's about making high-level choices about how different parts of a system work together.

---

## Why is System Design Important?

1. **Scalability**: Design systems that handle growth—more users, more data, more requests.
2. **Reliability**: Build systems that work correctly, even when things go wrong.
3. **Maintainability**: Create systems that are easy to understand, modify, and extend.
4. **Performance**: Ensure systems respond quickly and handle load efficiently.

## Types of System Design

### High-Level Design (HLD)

Focuses on the overall architecture:
- System components and their interactions
- Data flow between services
- Technology choices (databases, caching, messaging)
- Infrastructure decisions (cloud, load balancing, CDN)

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

Focuses on implementation details:
- Class diagrams and object relationships
- API contracts and method signatures
- Database schemas
- Design patterns within components

## Key Concepts to Master

| **Concept** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Scalability | Ability to handle increased load |
| Availability | System uptime and accessibility |
| Consistency | Data accuracy across the system |
| Latency | Response time for requests |
| Throughput | Number of operations per unit time |
| Fault Tolerance | Handling failures gracefully |

## System Design Interview Process

A typical system design interview follows these steps:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Understand functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Estimate Scale**: Calculate expected load, storage, and bandwidth
3. **Define High-Level Design**: Sketch the main components
4. **Deep Dive**: Explore specific components in detail
5. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Discuss trade-offs and optimizations

## Real-World Example

**Designing a URL Shortener:**

- **Functional**: Shorten URLs, redirect to original
- **Non-functional**: Low latency, high availability
- **Components**: API servers, database, cache
- **Scale**: Millions of URLs, billions of redirects

---

## Interview Tips

- Always **clarify requirements** before designing
- Think about **scale from the start**—millions of users, not hundreds
- Discuss **trade-offs** explicitly (CAP theorem, cost vs performance)
- Use **real-world examples** to support your design choices
- Don't forget about **failure scenarios** and how to handle them

System design is both an art and a science. The more systems you study, the better your intuition becomes for making the right architectural decisions.
