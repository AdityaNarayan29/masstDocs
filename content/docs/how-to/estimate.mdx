## 📊 Estimate Scale

Estimating scale helps you choose the right technologies, plan for growth, and communicate your understanding of real-world systems.

---

## ✅ What to Estimate?

1. 👥 Users (DAU / MAU)
2. 🔄 Requests / Query per second (RPS / QPS)
3. 📦 Storage
4. 🧮 Bandwidth

---

## 👥 1. Estimate Users

Estimate Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) based on the app type.

**Heuristics:**
- Social media: DAU ≈ 10–30% of MAU
- Admin/dashboard apps: DAU ≈ MAU
- Ticketing/event apps: Spiky traffic

> **Example:**  
> If MAU is 10M, assume 1–3M DAU.

**Say in interview:**
> “Let’s assume 5M monthly active users, and around 1M daily active users.”

---

## 🔄 2. Requests Per Second (RPS)

### 🎯 Formula

```
RPS ≈ (DAU × Requests per User per Day) ÷ 10^6
```

Use `10^6` (instead of 86400 seconds in a day) for simplicity in interviews.

### 🧠 Example

- DAU = 1,000,000
- Avg 5 requests/day/user

```
RPS = (1M × 5) ÷ 1M ≈ 5 RPS
```

**Advanced: Split by Type**
- 70% reads → 3.5 RPS
- 30% writes → 1.5 RPS

> “We’ll need to optimize for reads and cache aggressively.”

---

## 📦 3. Estimate Storage

### 🎯 Formula

```
Storage = Avg object size × Number of objects
```

### Example

- 1 post = 500 bytes
- 10M posts/month = 10^6 posts/month

```
Storage = 500 bytes × 10^6 = ~5 GB/month
```

Use `10^6` (instead of 1024 take `10^3` in unit calculation) for simplicity in interviews.

- 1-year retention = 60 GB

> “We’ll need ~5 GB/month, or ~60 GB/year for post storage.”

---

## 🧮 4. Estimate Bandwidth

### 🎯 Formula

```
Bandwidth = RPS × Avg response size
```

### Example

- 60 RPS
- Avg response = 50 KB

```
Bandwidth = 60 × 50 KB = 3 MB/s
```

- Daily: 3 MB/s × 86400 = ~250 GB/day

> “Our outgoing traffic will be ~250 GB/day, mainly due to read-heavy load.”

## 📋 Summary Table

| Metric        | Formula                        | Example                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Users**     | Estimate DAU from MAU         | MAU = 10M → DAU ≈ 1–3M         |
| **RPS**       | (DAU × reqs/day) ÷ 10^6       | (1M × 5) ÷ 10^6 = ~5 RPS       |
| **Storage**   | Size/item × # of items        | 500 B × 10M = ~5 GB/month      |
| **Bandwidth** | RPS × response size           | 60 RPS × 50 KB = ~3 MB/s       |

---

## 💡 Interview Power Move

Say something like:

> “Given 1M DAU and ~5 RPS, we expect read-heavy traffic, so we’ll cache results using Redis/CDN. Storage needs are modest (~5 GB/month), and bandwidth can be optimized via compression.”

**Tip:** Clear, quantitative estimates show you understand real-world system constraints and can communicate trade-offs effectively.
