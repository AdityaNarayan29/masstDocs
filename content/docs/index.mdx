title: System Design Guide
description: A comprehensive guide for learning and mastering system design concepts, HLD and LLD case studies.
---

Welcome to the **System Design Documentation**.  
This guide is designed to help you understand system design principles, learn from real-world examples, and master both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** patterns.

# Why System Design?

System design is a core skill for software engineers, especially for interviews, architecture planning, and building scalable, reliable systems.

## Guided Paths

Inspired by [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

### Path 1: Beginners
- Start with basics → Learn key components → Do small case studies

### Path 2: Intermediate
- Learn about scaling and distributed systems
- Practice HLD + LLD combos

### Path 3: Advanced
- Deep dive into cloud-native architecture, event-driven systems, and advanced caching strategies

## Interview Preparation

1. **Patterns to Master**
   - Sharding
   - Replication
   - Leader election
   - Rate limiting

2. **Mock Interview Tips**
   - Clarify requirements first
   - Draw block diagrams
   - Mention trade-offs
